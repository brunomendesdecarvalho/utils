ASC II: when the code is executed, prints most of the ASC II table (the useful stuff);

bm_math: a list of mathmatical functions:

1 - sequence: prints a sequence of numbers, from 'start' to 'finish', following a step. If start < finish, it increases, else, it decreases. If start = 1 and step = 2, you'll get a odd sequence. If start = 2 and step = 2, you'll get an even sequence;

2 - factorial: calculates the factorial of a number;

3 - arithmetic_progression: returns a list containing an arithmetic progression, given the start, limit and ratio. Last member will be the highest lower than or equal to limit;

4 - sum_arithmetic: returns the sum of all terms from an arithmetic progression, given the first, last and quantity of terms;

5 - geometric_progression: returns a list containing a geometric progression, given the start, limit and ratio. Last member will be the highest lower than or equal to limit;

6 - sum_geometric_finite: returns the sum of all terms from an finite geometric progression, given its first member, ratio and the quantity of members;

7 - sum_geometric_infinite: returns the sum of all terms from an infinite geometric progression, given its first member and ratio. Function will work as long as -1 < ratio < 1.

8 - is_prime: returns 'True', if given number is prime, or 'False', if it isn't;

9 - higher_number: receive given quantity of numbers, returns the higher of them;

10 - triangle_numbers: receive given quantity of numbers, returns a list containing *quantity* of triangle numbers;

11 - find_x: receive a, b and c from a squaring function, analyses delta and returns its roots.
